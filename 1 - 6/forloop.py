# ------------------ for loop ------------------
# for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
# for loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for i in list:
#     print(i)
    
# Print all the numbers in the list multiplied by 2
# for i in list:
#     print(i*2)
    
# Sum of first natural numbers
sum = 0
# for i in list:
#     sum = sum + i
# print(sum)

# Sum of a range of numbers
sum1 = 0
# for j in range(1, 6):
#     print(j)
#     sum1 = sum1 + j

# print(sum1)


# ------------------ for loops 2 ------------------
# Third argument in range function is the step argument
# for i in range(1, 10, 2):
#     print(i)
    
# Using only one argument in range function will start from 0 and go upto the number mentioned in the argument
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
